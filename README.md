## Description
> This project is an exam project for the course NLP of the Master's in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University.

This repository contains scripts and resources for a project, which aimed to expand the Danish sentiment lexicon [sentida2](https://github.com/Guscode/Sentida2). Specifically, the project used word2vec and fasttext word embeddings, trainined of the [Danish Gigaword corpus](https://gigaword.dk) to predict the sentiment of new words and thereby expand the sentiment lexicon. Linear regression and neural network models were trained on the existing sentiment lexicon to predict the sentiment scores of the 10.000 to 20.000 words in the Danish language. Subsequently, the sentiment model [asent](https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/asent) was used to compare the base lexicon [sentida2](https://github.com/Guscode/Sentida2) to the extended lexicon.

## Usage

**!** The scripts have only been tested on Linux, using Python 3.9.1.  

To run the scripts, I recommend cloning this repository and installing necessary dependencies in a virtual environment. Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
